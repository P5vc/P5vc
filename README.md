# Welcome to the community behind Priveasy.org!

###### If you are new here, please visit our [About](https://github.com/P5vc/Documentation/blob/master/About/About.md#overview "About") page to learn more about us!

### Priveasy.org is currently powered by six repositories:

## [P5vc](https://github.com/P5vc/P5vc "P5vc")

**P5vc** is our profile repository. Its unique purpose is to provide you with this greeting message.

## [Documentation](https://github.com/P5vc/Documentation "Documentation")

**Documentation** is used to store all of the data relevant to Priveasy's backend and internal operations... yet nothing contained within this repository is actual code which runs on our servers. In this repository you'll find helpful, technical information for both users and contributors, along with other resources such as code standards, logo files, and DNS configurations.

## [FetchApply](https://github.com/P5vc/FetchApply "FetchApply")

**FetchApply** is a lightweight configuration tool designed to allow for complete server configuration and management, while maintaining the maximum amount of transparency possible. We use FetchApply on all of our servers.

## [ServerConfigurations](https://github.com/P5vc/ServerConfigurations "ServerConfigurations")

**ServerConfigurations** is exactly what it sounds like. This repository contains the exact code that FetchApply, well, fetches and applies to our servers, in order to set them up from scratch, configure them, and maintain them. If you are interested in server management or security, this is the repository for you!

## [WebserverBackend](https://github.com/P5vc/WebserverBackend "WebserverBackend")

**WebserverBackend** contains our web application backend. Unlike ServerConfigurations, which aims to configure and maintain the physical servers themselves, WebserverBackend focuses on processing requests made to Priveasy's website, and then properly communicating with our databases and other necessary entities in order to return a proper response. If you are interested in web design, web applications, or Django, this is the repository for you!

## [VPNServerBackend](https://github.com/P5vc/VPNServerBackend "VPNServerBackend")

**VPNServerBackend** contains the script automatically run by our VPN servers in order to manage user accounts, firewall rules, etc. If you are interested in server security or VPN configurations, this is the repository for you!
